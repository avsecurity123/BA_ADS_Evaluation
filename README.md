# On Evaluating Physical Backdoor Attacks to Camera and LiDAR Perception in Autonomous Vehicles


## Introduction
In this work, we demonstrate that different functions including obstacle detection, lane detection and traffic light detection are susceptible to physical backdoor attacks, where physical objects can be abused as triggers, thus revealing severe security threat to Autonomous Vehicles (AV). 

## Installation
First, create a conda virtual environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n avba python=3.8 -y
conda activate avba
```
Then, clone this directory and install other packages:
```
git clone git@github.com:avsecurity123/BA_ADS_Evaluation.git
cd BA_ADS_Evaluation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
